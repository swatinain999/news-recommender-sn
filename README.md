# News Recommendation System

A content-based news recommendation system that suggests news articles similar to a given headline using cosine similarity.

## Project Overview

This project implements a news recommendation engine leveraging natural language processing techniques. It computes the cosine similarity between news article texts (headlines and short descriptions) to identify and recommend articles that are contextually similar.

The system is built in Python using popular libraries for data manipulation, text processing, and visualization. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (including WordCloud visualizations), and a recommendation function based on cosine similarity.

## Features

- Content-based filtering using cosine similarity on news text data
- Supports multiple news categories for better contextual recommendations
- Interactive Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step development and visualization
- WordCloud visualizations for insights into frequent keywords per category
- Easy to extend with more advanced NLP models or hybrid recommendation methods

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn (cosine similarity)
- Matplotlib & WordCloud (visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook
