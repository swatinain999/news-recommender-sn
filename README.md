# 📰 News Recommendation System

A **content-based news recommendation system** that suggests news articles similar to a given headline using **cosine similarity**.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a news recommendation engine leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. It computes cosine similarity between news article texts (headlines and short descriptions) to identify and recommend contextually similar articles.

The system is built in Python and includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (including WordCloud visualizations)
- A recommendation function based on cosine similarity

---

## ✨ Features
- Content-based filtering using cosine similarity on news text data  
- Supports multiple news categories for better contextual recommendations  
- Interactive Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step development & visualization  
- WordCloud visualizations for keyword insights per category  
- Easy to extend with more advanced NLP models or hybrid methods  

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (cosine similarity, TF-IDF)  
- Matplotlib & WordCloud  
- Jupyter Notebook
